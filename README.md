The goal behind this frisson detector was to track my mind during intense meditation sessions where I produce frisson chills from 1-2 minutes in length.
By unlocking this secret super power from within, one can always center themselves anywhere and anytime. A jolt of frisson dopamine is better than any drug and will always instantly reward you.

The application tracks three parts of the brain via the Neurosity. 

  RPF: "F6",  // Right Prefrontal
  
  RC: "C4",   // Right Central
  
  RT: "CP4"   // Right Temporal


  Prefrontal Cortex: Increased theta activity here, particularly in the right prefrontal area, correlates with heightened arousal and emotional pleasure, especially during peak "chill" moments. This activity is often associated with the orbitofrontal cortex, an area involved in reward processing.

Right Central Region: Decreased theta activity here may reflect the activation of the supplementary motor area, suggesting involvement in processing rhythmic anticipation and potentially in motor-related responses to music.

Right Temporal Region: A decrease in theta activity here could indicate activation of the right superior temporal gyrus, an area linked to musical appreciation and emotional response.
  
 Right-hemisphere emphasis:

During chills there is increased theta in the right prefrontal cortex → linked with orbitofrontal cortex reward processing.

The right central and right temporal regions also show decreases in theta, suggesting engagement of SMA and right superior temporal gyrus.

This makes it look like chills are “mostly in the right hemisphere.”

Left Hemisphere Handling:

For theta: We are ignoring left ROIs entirely. This is OK since the biggest effects with the current EEG are right-lateralized.

For alpha asymmetry: We bring left-side channels (F5, C3, CP3) into play. That aligns with the frontal/prefrontal alpha asymmetry analysis (R−L). 

Final thoughts:

I believe testing will be improved drastically with an extra eeg on the prefontal cortex. We will just have to wait and see!

ABSTRACT=Music has the capacity to elicit strong positive feelings in humans by activating the brain’s reward system. Since group’s emotional dynamics is a central concern of social neurosciences, the study of emotion in natural/ecological conditions gain interest. This study aimed to show that High Density EEG (HD-EEG) is able to reveal patterns of cerebral activities previously identified by fMRI or PET scans when the subject experiences pleasurable musical chills. Participants (11 female, 7 male) were recorded by HD-EEG while listening to their favourite pleasurable chill-inducing musical excerpt; they reported their subjective emotional state from low pleasure up to chills. HD-EEG results showed an increase of theta activity in the prefrontal cortex when arousal and emotional ratings increased, which are associated with orbitofrontal cortex activation localised using source localisation algorithms. In addition, two specific pattern of chills has been identified; a decreased theta activity in the right central region could reflect supplementary motor area (SMA) activation during chills, may be related to rhythmic anticipation processing. A decreased theta activity in the right temporal region may be related to musical appreciation. The alpha frontal/prefrontal asymmetry did not reflect the felt emotional pleasure but the increased arousal (frontal beta/alpha ratio) corresponded to increased emotional ratings. These results correspond with fMRI and PET findings, thus confirming that EEG is a reliable method and a promising tool for the investigation of group musical pleasure through musical reward processing.

The goal behind this frisson detector was to track my mind during intense meditation sessions where I produce frisson chills from 1-2 minutes in length.
By unlocking this secret super power from within, one can always center themselves anywhere and anytime. A jolt of frisson dopamine is better than any drug and will always instantly reward you.

The application tracks three parts of the brain via the Neurosity. 

  RPF: "F6",  // Right Prefrontal
  RC: "C4",   // Right Central
  RT: "CP4"   // Right Temporal

  

  I believe testing will be improved drastically with an extra eeg on the prefontal cortex. We will just have to wait and see!
